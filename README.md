# radio

Radio is a simple program that turns a Raspberry Pi into a radio that can play
audio from a number of different sources.


## Sources

These are the sources that have been implemented for now:

- Web stream
- Airplay
- Bluetooth


## Configuration

The radio can be configured via a config file (default `radio.json` or can be
set using the `-c` flag). See [`radio.json`](radio.json) for an example configuration.


## Hardware

In the future I will post hardware I've used to build the radio here, as well as
schema's on how to wire up the GPIO for the control knobs.
